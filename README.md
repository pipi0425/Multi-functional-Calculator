# Multi-functional-Calculator
Unfinished

Start date: Apr. 5th, 2019

This is just a practice of modularization and some basic stuff of C programming.

Note: I am using Visual Studio for this whole program so some functions follow microsoft compiler standards  
i.e. `scanf_s(" %c", &command, sizeof(command))` instead of `scanf(" %c", &command)`

Plan: after Apr. 16th (the 4th final of this semester), implement more functions (basic stuff (i.e. polynomials, etc.) and some recently learnt stuff(i.e. calculation involved in elementary number theory, etc.))

---

### Todo List:
- [ ] Finish `polynomials.c`for eigenvalue section
- [ ] Include polynomials in main
- [ ] More functions for number theory calculation
- [ ] Modify commands to prevent previous commands interrupting next input
- [ ] Try to convert this program to javascript and make GUI in html
